## The Theory

If you attended a Model UN conference, your committee chairs will probably use a
chalkboard or a Microsoft Word document to manage the general speakers lists,
the rolling speakers list, quorum, and speaking time. This is inefficent and
gets messy fast.

mun.track is a sleek online dashboard for your Model UN committee that
eliminates the pain. mun.track runs in any modern web browser and is designed to
be projected in front of your delegates.

## Operating instructions

mun.track is controlled by typing commands at the prompt at the bottom of the
screen. The learning curve is a bit steep, but

* once you learn the keyboard commands, you'll be whizzing around much faster
  than you could with a mouse
* the command-line is the only interface discreet enough to not disrupt your
  delegates.

To run a command, simply type its name and press &lt;enter>. Then follow any
relevant prompts.

### Display configuration

and mun.track projected behind you. We recommend you enable the "mirror
displays" option to project exactly what appears on your screen so you're aware
of what your delegates can see.
